The intermediate level of involvement will correspond on coding the data organization and container launching scripts. The highest level of involvement will be coding the Python and Matlab codes within the container so that it can read qMRI data and provide the tract specific metrics. The three levels or involvement will run in parallel. First milestone will be to plan what each parallel line will need to accomplish and how (so training on the tool will be given). The second milestone will be to do the actual coding. The third milestone will be to combine the three branches for testing and improving it iteratively until it is working. \n\n## What will participants learn:\nWhat is diffusion imaging and how it works. qMRI. Running a diffusion pipeline from dicom images to tract metrics. Containerization technology (Docker and Singularity). Python and Matlab. Git (working with a branch within a fork and creating a pull request)\n\n## Number of collaborators:\n3\n\n## Credit to collaborators:\nThey will be in a contributing page in the main repo.\n\n## Type of project:\nPipeline development\n\n## Programming languages:\nMatlab, Python, Containerization (Docker and Singularity)\n\n## Necessary git skills level for the project:\nBasic (commit & push)\n\n## Modality:\nDWI, MRI, qMRI\n\n## Software suites:\nAFNI, ANTs, BIDS, fMRIPrep, Freesurfer, FSL, MRtrix, the pipeline uses many different softwares..."
