Based on a journal's review process, write a prompt chain to evaluate how ready an article is to publish / how well its analyses are described.\r\n\r\n2. Based on a specific review papers criteria, write \r\n\n\n### Communication channels\n\nhttps://github.com/bcmcpher/reviewer2go\n\n### Skills\n\n- Python - Basic\r\n    -  LangChain - preferred\r\n- Git - preferred\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\nWe'll learn how to interact with different LLMs while building LangChain prompts to extract specific information or otherwise summarize the technical writing of an article.\n\n### Data to use\n\n_No response_\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\nmore\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nWe'll track contributions and decide what kind of product for the hackathon (or other future work) as we go.\r\n\r\nHopefully, we can get to a small demo for [NeuroLibre](https://neurolibre.org/)\n\n### Image\n\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\n\n### Type\n\nother\n\n### Development status\n\n0_concept_no_content\n\n### Topic\n\nreproducible_scientific_methods\n\n### Tools\n\nother\n\n### Programming language\n\nPython\n\n### Modalities\n\nother, not_applicable\n\n### Git skills\n\n1_commit_push\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [ ] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
