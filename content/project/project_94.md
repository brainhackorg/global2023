Currently, physiopy supports and maintains[ phys2bids](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a library that standardizes raw physiological data in accordance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The community is also developing and managing other libraries like peakdet (processing and analysing), Phys2Denoise (producing physiological regressors for neuroimaging denoising), and PhysioQC (quality control). All those libraries produce a bunch of different derivatives. However, the derivatives structure and requirements for physiological data (i.e. cardiac, respiratory, blood pressure, etc.) are not yet covered by the BIDS specification. With this project, we are hoping to start a discussion around an eventual BIDS proposal on physiological derivatives. \r\n\r\nThis project does not require coding skills to join. If you are enthusiastic about physiological data, BIDS, both, or just a curious person, we\u2019re happy to have you on board!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/orgs/physiopy](https://github.com/orgs/physiopy)\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\nOpen discussion on how to BIDSify physiological data derivatives (i.e. preprocessed data, peaks, troughs, rvt, hrv, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\nCome and join the discussion!\r\nhttps://github.com/orgs/physiopy/projects/3/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\n#bids_derivatives channel on https://discord.gg/GyeeVbYC \r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n- Physiological data: cardiac, respiratory, skin conductance etc. [all levels]\r\n- BIDS standards: intermediate/advanced\r\n- Data management: all levels\r\n- github: all levels\r\n- python: intermediate/advanced\r\n\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about BIDS standards, and derivatives management.\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nContributors are welcome to participate in drafting the physiological derivatives BIDS Extension Proposal (BEP), and be listed among the authors.\r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\n![physiopy_bids](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2023/assets/77584086/be852556-9298-4482-9afa-e8555af45725)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\ndata_management\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n0_concept_no_content\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\nphysiology\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nBIDS\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\nnot_applicable\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n0_no_git_skills\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\r\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
