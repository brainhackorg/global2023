Bayrak (@rgbayrak)\r\nroza.g.bayrak@vanderbilt.edu\r\n\r\n### Collaborators\r\n\r\nStefano Moia (@smoia), Lars Kasper (@mrikasper), David Romero\r\n\r\n### Brainhack Global 2022 Event\r\n\r\nBrainhack Physiopy\r\n\r\n### Project Description\r\n\r\n`peakdet` aims to provide a set of tools that will work with a variety of input data to reproducibly generate analysis-ready physiological data. \r\n\r\n`peakdet` is designed for use in the reproducible processing and analysis of physiological data, like those collected from respiratory belts, pulse photoplethysmography (PPG), or electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) monitors.\r\n\r\n**What makes your project special and exciting?** \r\nPhysiological monitoring is a key component of understanding physiological sources of signal variance in fMRI data. Monitoring physiology during scanning is critical to enable the characterization of a given subject's physiologic state at the time of the scan, and to track variations in physiology throughout the scan. With these data, we can more accurately model how these factors manifest in the fMRI signal time series.\r\n\r\n**How to get started?** <br /> \r\nJoin our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/physiopy/shared_invite/zt-1k2kn2ibl-UjSPQe5LxgNGSWiS8ClbVg) channel! \r\n\r\n**Where to find key resources?** <br /> \r\nDocumentation: https://peakdet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nDocumentation: https://peakdet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <br /> \r\nGithub: https://github.com/physiopy/peakdet \r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\n- Pipeline comparison\r\n- Integrate with NeuroKit and learn from PhysIO Toolbox\r\n- QC\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] Compare existing pipelines to peakdet pipeline\r\n- [ ] Create a data folder structure for dev\r\n- [ ] Run existing pipelines on your data, on example data\r\n- [ ] Minimal changes to repo - good first github issue! \r\n- [ ] Update documentation - clarify usage, describe methods (advanced physio knowledge)\r\n- [ ] Refactor code (advanced python)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\n[Slack!](https://join.slack.com/t/physiopy/shared_invite/zt-1k2kn2ibl-UjSPQe5LxgNGSWiS8ClbVg)\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n\r\n- Python: Basic \r\n(there is no skill level requirement but advanced programming experience would be helpful)\r\n- Physiological Signal Knowledge: Basic\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\nThis is going to be an exercise in testing, understanding and documenting. You will learn:\r\n\r\n- to visualize and process physiological time-series data\r\n- to contribute to an Open Source project and collaborate on Github\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\nSee the issues! \r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nWe're looking for code contributors, but any suggestion/bug report is welcome!
