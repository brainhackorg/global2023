Conventional methods of clustering in fMRI allow to see spatial patterns but cannot describe the temporal dynamics of functional activity. \r\n\r\n- What makes your project special and exciting?\r\nProviding a tool for researchers interested in analyzing brain patterns in uncontrolled fmri experiments or clinical settings is a necessity that has not been covered yet and that could be done through clustintime. \r\n\r\n- How to get started?\r\nClustintime has been under development for a few years and has been already tried on data from individual epileptic patients, the skeletton of the project is already done, now there is need to transform it into a proper toolbox to release the first version of the software. \r\n\r\n- Where to find key resources?\r\nThe project already has its repository on GitHub (https://github.com/Cristina-Tobias/clustintime) and a public fMRI data will be used for testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Cristina-Tobias/clustintime\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\nCreate integration testing suite/framework\r\nCreate CI/CD pipeline \r\nPopulate CI/CD pipeline with checks\r\n\r\n**Release version 0.1.0** \r\n\r\nCreate documentation\r\nImprove user experience of adding input\r\nStructure output messages\r\n\r\n**Release version 0.2.0**\r\n\r\nIntroduce new features\r\n- group analysis\r\n- consensus clustering\r\n\r\n**Release version 1.0.0**\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\nIssue 1: Create integration testing suite/framework\r\n- Find usable data\r\n- Execute each algorithm in a reproducible way (fix seed)\r\n- Integrate into CI/CD pipeline\r\n\r\nIssue 2: Create CI/CD pipeline \r\n- Find free tier provider\r\n- e.g., github actions, circleci\r\n\r\nIssue 3: Populate CI/CD pipeline with checks\r\n- Pylint, flake8, black, isort, ...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/clustintime\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n- Git: intermediate\r\n- Python: advanced (only for those that want to develop new methods)\r\n- Markdown: intermediate\r\n- Bash: begginer\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\n- Experience on collaborating with git \r\n- Experience on how to design and build an open-source library\r\n- Different methods of fMRI visualization\r\n- Unsupervised machine learning methods for fMRI\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nProject contributors will be acknowledged as contributors in GitHub, credit will also be given in future publications (if any) to those who make a major contribution to the toolbox. \r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\ncoding_methods, documentation, method_development, pipeline_development\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n1_basic structure\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\ndata_visualisation, machine_learning\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\nPython\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nfMRI\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n2_branches_PRs\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\r\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
