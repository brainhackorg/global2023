Analysis pipelines for neuroimaging data typically rely on specific versions of packages and software, and are dependent on their native operating system. These dependencies mean that a working analysis pipeline may fail or produce different results on a new computer, or even on the same computer after a software update. \r\n\r\n\r\n- What makes your project special and exciting?\r\nNeurodesk provides a platform in which anyone, anywhere, using any computer can reproduce your original research findings given the original data and analysis code.\r\n\r\n- How to get started?\r\nhttps://www.neurodesk.org/docs/neurodesktop/getting-started/play/\r\n\r\n- Where to find key resources?\r\nhttps://www.neurodesk.org/\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\nhttps://github.com/NeuroDesk\n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\n- make container contribution ALOT easier (ideas: interactive container building on the neurodesk play platform itself - no install required; generating docker recipes based on the interactive install steps recorded)\r\n- running Neurodesk on ARM and Apple M1/2 chips\r\n- Develop Notebook experience of Neurodesk: the unerlying jupyter instance could be used to develop pipelines directly in jupyter without requiring the full desktop experience: https://play-sydney.neurodesk.org/v2/gh/neurodesk/jupyter-neurodesktop-image/main - for this we would like to develop a better user experience and example notebooks\n\n### Good first issues\n\n1. issue one:\r\nContribute a new container for Neurodesk of your favorite tool: https://www.neurodesk.org/developers/new_tools/add_tool/ \r\n\r\n\r\n2. issue two:\r\n\n\n### Communication channels\n\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/virtual-neuro-machine-vnm\n\n### Skills\n\n- Python\r\n- Bash\r\n- Github\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\nBuilding software containers\n\n### Data to use\n\n_No response_\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\nmore\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nContributions are listed here: https://www.neurodesk.org/developers/contributors/\n\n### Image\n\n![AEDAPT_Brain_Logo_Box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4021595/203456880-f3897a7e-0cf9-4507-a02c-3d1106fc9c52.png)\r\n\n\n### Type\n\ncoding_methods, documentation, method_development, pipeline_development, visualization\n\n### Development status\n\n2_releases_existing\n\n### Topic\n\nreproducible_scientific_methods\n\n### Tools\n\nother\n\n### Programming language\n\ncontainerization, documentation, Python, shell_scripting\n\n### Modalities\n\nnot_applicable\n\n### Git skills\n\n3_continuous_integration\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [X] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [X] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
