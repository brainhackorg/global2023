In poorly cued environments (e.g. in darkness) this can only be done by estimating the direction and the distance in order to compute a vectorial integration of the movement (so called path-integration). In a set of studies in rats we demonstrated that the entorhinal cortex plays a fundamental role in path integration. However, how the circuit infers the running distance is yet to be known. Using a distance estimation task, we discovered that the theta oscillations of the local field potential and the firing pattern of single neurons in the entorhinal cortex correlate with the running distance estimated by the rats. But how much and how well the unitary and the field activity allow the circuit to infer about the travelled distance?\r\nIn the context of the BrainHack Marseille 2022, we would like to interact and collaborate with people with a good knowledge of neural decoding of EEG-LFP and/or unitary activity in order to implement proper methods to decode the estimated running distance starting from a dataset of electrophysiology recordings in behaving rats.
