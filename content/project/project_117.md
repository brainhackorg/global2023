For self-awareness implications, see for instance research from [Olaf Blanke](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/127/2/243/347826). I expect positive implications for users, including increased self awareness and increased focus, and interesting implications for users undergoing temporary stress or anxiety. If the issue of learning to associate somatosensory information to the new way of seeing the world can be solved, this could open the door to many more experiments around metacognition, but also around learning involving perception and movement of the body. Inspired by the study of Hubert Dolezal in 1982, using prism glasses to experience the world upside-down.\r\n\r\n- What makes your project special and exciting?\r\n- Visuo-tactile association in third-person point of view is hard to achieve. The challenge revolves around how to make the brain learn that association. One candidate approach is to start from a first-person point of view and gradually transition to a third-person point of view, using a camera transmitting its video feed to a headset worn by the user. Existing solutions exist for drone piloting (FPV goggles).\r\n\r\n- How to get started?\r\n- Identify the bottlenecks to come. Propose a design solution to allow for a gradual transition from first-person to third-person point of view. Experiment with FPV goggles and bring them to the Brainhack :)\r\nThe outcome of this project should be in the form of schematics, prototypes, pseudocode, people to reach out to and a list of resources to take inspiration from.\r\n\r\n- Where to find key resources?\r\n- By typing \"fpv goggles third person\" in a search engine\r\n- https://petapixel.com/2014/07/02/custom-built-oculus-rift-gopro-rig-lets-experience-life-third-person/\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anE3RNf_3s0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\n[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jN9d5g_HwmBDktQSOZDhtqTnUc2ZP8Vvep4LntVyueI/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this project should be in the form of schematics, pseudocode, people to reach out to and a list of resources to take inspiration from.\r\nIteration cycles should be as short as possible.\r\nTesting should ideally happen on-site during the hackathon.\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n1. Gradual transition from 1st person to 3rd person - engineering task\r\n\r\n2. Visuo-tactile association in shifted or novel ways of viewing the world - literature review task\r\n\r\n3. Getting your hands on a drone and FPV goggles - engineering task\r\n\r\n4. Identifying if using a stereo camera will prove crucial - literature review task\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\nDirect messaging app - TBD\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n- sensorimotor association: 40%\r\n- engineering and coding: 30%\r\n- fast iteration mindset: 20%\r\n- VR technologies: 10%\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\nSensorimotor association, mental states, self-awareness, engineering and coding, and iterating fast\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nNames engraved on a block of cheese and fed to seaguls\r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\nhttps://art-u1.infcdn.net/articles_uploads/0/811/3rd%20person%20real%20life.jpg\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\nmethod_development\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n0_concept_no_content\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\nnot_applicable\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nbehavioral\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n0_no_git_skills\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\r\n- [X] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
