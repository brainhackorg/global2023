Inspired by [recent work](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/3ffebb08d23c609875d7177ee769a3e9-Abstract.html) proposing using cutting-edge RNNs to model interactions between sub-cortical structures I would like to explore how RNNs could be used to model other aspects of sub-cortical functions.\r\n\r\nWhile there have been a number of analogies made between cortical regions and non-recurrent ANNs (e.g. convolutional neural networks and visual cortex), RNNs are almost certainly required to recapitulate the state changes and motor output driven by sub-cortical regions.\r\n\r\nAs this this project is just at conception, please feel free to find me at the Australian BrainHack to sit down and spit-ball some ideas.\r\n\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\nhttps://github.com/tclose/bhg-subcortical-rnn\n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\n* Identify hypothesised sub-cortical functions that would be good candidates for modelling\r\n* Identify the best tools to develop such models (e.g. PyTorch)\r\n* Come up with a collection of generic Python scripts/modules that can be used as a starting point for such projects\r\n* Publish some strategies and learnings on the process\n\n### Good first issues\n\n1. issue one: Read/bring some interesting papers to discuss\r\n\r\n2. issue two: Bring knowledge of a particular sub-cortical pathway or cool new RNN architecture\r\n\n\n### Communication channels\n\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bhg-subcortical-rnn\n\n### Skills\n\n- Python: intermediate\r\n- ANNs concepts: intermediate\r\n- Brain anatomy: basic\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\nSorry, don't have this yet\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\nHopefully something about RNNs and sub-cortical anatomy/function\n\n### Data to use\n\nN/A\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\nmore\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nContributors to the code repository will be listed in the AUTHORS file (when it is created) and ideally a paper could come out of this project eventually.\n\n### Image\n\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\n\n### Type\n\nother\n\n### Development status\n\n0_concept_no_content\n\n### Topic\n\ndeep_learning, machine_learning, neural_networks, systems_neuroscience\n\n### Tools\n\nother\n\n### Programming language\n\nPython\n\n### Modalities\n\nnot_applicable\n\n### Git skills\n\n1_commit_push\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [ ] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
