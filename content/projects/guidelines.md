   Why a centralised project submission?
</h2>

As the Brainhack Global team, we aim to :

- create a (de)centralized collaborative working platform,
- facilitate & increase across-site collaborations and interactions,
- give more visibility to the projects run under Brainhack Global,
- encourage sharing ideas, experiences and knowledge across parties,
- to remove barriers and allow contributions by researchers from all origins and
  disciplines.

Given that many events in this year Brainhack Global might be in part run
virtually, a common platform for project submission and listing will allow you
to submit your initial project call to gather interests from researchers from
all Brainhack Global event locations.

   Submitting a project
</h2>

Please read our
**[Guidelines for Leading and Attending to Brainhack Projects](https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials/blob/master/docs/leading_and_attending_to_brainhack_projects.md)**
to get more ideas about:

- how to design your project and what to expect from a Brainhack experience,
- how to lead a project,
- how to be an attendee of a project.

The ideal project should convey ideas with respect to the development of tools,
methodologies, guidelines and begets to brainstorming new ideas that would
facilitate the implementation of open science practices in neuroscience and
create more opportunities for collaborative work and information exchange within
the community.

   How does it work?
</h3>

In order to submit a project to the Brainhack Global 2022 Project Gallery,
please follow these steps:

1. Register with an event listed in the
   **[Brainhack Global 2022 Events](https://brainhack.org/global2022/events/)**.
1. Create a **[GitHub](http://github.com/)** account.
1. Use our project submission form and fill in the necessary/required
information as requested.

<h3 style="font-family:'Pacifico'; color:#fe97a0">
   What happens next?
</h3>

Once you have submitted your project, a reviewer will check the information in
your issue. They may request some changes if deemed necessary.

Once the review completed the project will be marked as `status:web_ready` and
will be listed on the
**[Brainhack Global 2022 Projects](https://brainhack.org/global2022/projects/)**
page after a short delay. A subpage dedicated to your own project will be
automatically created.

<h3 style="font-family:'Pacifico'; color:#fe97a0">
   Matching projects with participants
</h3>

The Brainhack Global team will try to match event attendees to projects across
the globe based the expertise/skill sets that attendees want to acquire and
those the projects are looking for. Once the attendee registrations are
completed, our matching algorithm will be run based on the information provided
by the attendees during registration. The attendees will then receive an email
listing the best fitting projects for their expertise and interests.

Of course, the project attendees decide to join is ultimately their own. They
could either go with the suggested options or they could choose among the other
projects listed in the
**[Brainhack Global 2022 Projects](https://brainhack.org/global2022/projects/)**
page.

Please be aware that, at the very early stage of the interactions, attendees
might just want to contact you for more information to make sure that the
project is a good fit to the aims they want to achieve from a Brainhack.
Therefore, please make sure that you welcome all attentions and explain your
project with care and guide them as necessary.
