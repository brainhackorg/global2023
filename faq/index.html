What is Brainhack Global? What is the difference between global and local event sites?
<span class="fa-stack fa-sm ml-auto"><i class="fas fa-plus fa-stack-1x ml-auto"></i></span></button></h2></div><div id=collapse-1 class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-1 data-parent=#ohmyaccordion><div class="card-body font-italic">Brainhack Global (BHG) is an umbrella term for all the hacking events run all around the world that brings reserchers from variety of subfields of neuroscience and in different seniority level to share open science practices and encourage the knowledge transfer across the community. The Brainhack Global is run by a central organizing committee, which is constituted by a volunteer team of researchers from a variety of research institutions. The team coordinates and helps in the planning and organization of the local events all around the world and is in charge of designing the proceedings of Brainhack Global as well as maintaining the Brainhack Global materials, websites, and social accounts.
Brainhack Global does not run a central hacking event on their own, but shares the information, materials, and broadcasts from all local event sites during the defined event period.
Local event sites refer to the local Brainhack events, where a group of researchers from local institutes comes together and runs hacking events for any period of time throughout of the year. These local events are entirely independent in designing their program and event schedule, tutorial materials, recruiting their attendees and speakers, and finding their funding and venues. The events might include educational tutorials, unconferences, hacking, and social events. The Brainhack Global team helps the local event sites by providing them with all the necessary guidelines and tools that would facilitate the organization of the local events and also helps them with the advertisement of their event all around the world via its website and social accounts.</div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header><h2 class=my-0><button class="d-flex align-items-center btn btn-link collapsed btn-nav-accordion" data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse-2 aria-expanded=false aria-controls=collapse-2>

Please do not undermine the contribution that would come from any of the attendees at the event. This is one of the important parts of the event. Be inclusive and open to the contributions. Especially be open to the early career researchers who are there to learn from you; please do not forget that once you were one of them too. Providing people with an environment to learn and improve themselves is one of the main goals and gains of the event. And again you would never be able to know which contribution an attendee could provide you with. Therefore, it is always better to keep yourself open to different ideas and contributions and to let the brainstorming help you achieve your project’s goals.</p><p>Depending on the Brainhack local event site, you might be asked to give a short presentation of your project (usually on the first day of the event) to inform attendees about the project aim(s) and the tasks to be done. Please using the template provided in the <a href=https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials target=_blank rel=noopener>Brainhack Github Repository</a>
prepare a short and clear presentation in accordance with the plan of the event site of your choice.
